<!-- end_slide -->

Softwares
===
- Completed 3 of 6 modules of a course in `Unity Essentials`
- Created a small car game to understand about the Unity engine and assets customization
- Mini Project: 3D human motion capture using python
    - uses computer vision to capture the human motion and export it into landmarks which is later used in Unity to render the movements of that human object.

Progress target for next 15 days
=== 

- 4-7 research papers on Intelligent Transportation System and understand the achitectures and use of AI discussed in those papers.
- Dive deeper into `Object Detection`
- Modify the 3D motion capture project  for `Vehicles` to simultaneously detect and render in Unity.
